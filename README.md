# 338_suture_paper code

Welcome to the 338_suture_paper code repository. This is a comprehensive analysis project for studying mouse suture development and miR-338 function, currently under peer review.

This repository contains two main analysis modules: miRNASeq analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNASeq) analysis, designed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of P9 mouse sutures across different genotypes.

### Differential Proportion Analysis Methods

The functions in `diffprop_functions.R` are adapted from the methodology described in:

**Farbehi, N., Patrick, R., Dorison, A., Xaymardan, M., Janbandhu, V., Wystub-Lis, K., Ho, J.W.K., Nordon, R.E., Harvey, R.P.** (2019). Single-cell expression profiling reveals dynamic flux of cardiac stromal, vascular and immune cells in health and injury. *eLife* 8:e43882. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.43882

The differential proportion analysis approach enables statistical comparison of cell type proportions between experimental conditions using permutation-based testing, which is particularly valuable for identifying condition-specific changes in cellular composition within single-cell datasets.
